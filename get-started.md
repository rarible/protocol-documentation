# Get Started

![Discord Discord & Slack Emoji](https://emoji.gg/assets/emoji/3970-discord.png) [Discord](https://discord.gg/3ByePUMAvB) is one of the main places where the DAO is being organised, and builders take their first steps towards building with the protocol.&#x20;

![blurple\_github Discord & Slack Emoji](https://emoji.gg/assets/emoji/3716-blurple-github.png) [Github](https://github.com/rarible) is where everything lives, since we are open-source, a lot of resources and help from other builders are available there.&#x20;
