# Get Started

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>) [Discord](https://discord.gg/3ByePUMAvB) is one of the main places where the DAO is being organised, and builders take their first steps towards building with the protocol.&#x20;

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)[Github](https://github.com/rarible) is where everything lives, since we are open-source, a lot of resources and help from other builders are available there.&#x20;

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>) [Notion](https://rarible-protocol.notion.site/rarible-protocol/Rarible-Protocol-DAO-f89d6db21a9d4c199eb30051fceb9a0a) is the platform where we hold information for DAO members and $RARI token holders.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>) [OpenAPI](https://ethereum-api.rarible.org/v0.1/doc) is the place where we document the current API capabilities.
