# Resources

## DAO

If you're a builder or you're looking to participate to the Rarible Protocol DAO here are a few useful places you'll find support and like-minded builders.

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/3ByePUMAvB) is one of the main places where the DAO is being organised, and builders take their first steps towards building with the protocol.
- [Github](https://github.com/rarible) is where everything lives, since we are open-source, a lot of resources and help from other builders are available there.
- [Notion](https://rarible-protocol.notion.site/rarible-protocol/Rarible-Protocol-DAO-f89d6db21a9d4c199eb30051fceb9a0a) is the platform where we hold information for DAO members and $RARI token holders.
- [OpenAPI](https://ethereum-api.rarible.org/v0.1/doc) is the place where we document the current API capabilities.
